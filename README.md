# Apex
We have chosen the "Make Commerce Happen" problem. Given the problem statement, we consider the entitites and use cases involved first. We have created a use case flow diagram and defined the various basic use cases that the platform has to handle. On top of that, we brainstormed some features that would help set us apart from the competition and some challenges and pros/cons in making them happen. We then started designing the schema for our database including details such as the tables and their fields, brainstorming on how to best optimize the underlying database for scalability since much of the scalability and manageability of the system is going to come from the database.

We have settled on the following additional features in the project on top of the basic requirements:
- Operation dependent discounts/offers for clients
- Auto up-grade deliveries for consumer (Wow factor)
- Configurable per-transaction or per-client based profit margins
- Priority based internal routing (faster/more cost effective deliveries)
- Multiple priority options for the client for improved delivery speeds / lower costs
